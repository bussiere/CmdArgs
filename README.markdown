CmdArgs
=======

CmdArgs is an attempt towards a solution for parsing command line arguments in traditional C programs. It tries to trade flexibility for ease of use, and does its job by abusing the C preprocessor. For a quick start, see GettingStarted.pdf (it needs to be compiled from GettingStarted.tex first). The test cases should also be a good starting point.
