CmdArgs
=======

CmdArgs is an attempt to come up with a solution for parsing command line arguments for traditional C programs. It tries to trade flexibility for ease of use, and does its job by (heavily) abusing the C preprocessor. While looking at the files in the test directory should be a hint, a more elaborate tutorial is in the making.
